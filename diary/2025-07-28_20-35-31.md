## Task: Create Sanitized Sample Execution Log

### Objective

Create a secure, sanitized version of the DSIM simulation log file for commit as a sample reference.

### Work Performed

1. **Security Analysis of Original Log**:
   - Identified personal information in file paths (user directory: `C:\Users\Nautilus\`)
   - Identified workspace-specific paths that should be generalized
   - Preserved functional information (test results, timing, UVM hierarchy)

2. **Sanitization Process**:
   - Replaced personal user paths with `${DSIM_HOME}` environment variable
   - Replaced workspace paths with `${WORKSPACE_PATH}` environment variable
   - Maintained all functional test information and results
   - Preserved warning messages and compilation details

3. **Files Created**:
   - `docs/sample_execution_log.txt`: Sanitized log file
   - `docs/sample_execution_log_readme.md`: Documentation explaining the sample

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Verified `.gitignore` excludes actual log files (`sim/exec/dsim.log`)
   - Sample files placed in `docs/` directory for easy identification
   - Clear naming convention indicating these are samples

### Technical Insights

- **Log Structure**: DSIM logs contain clear phases (Analysis → Elaboration → Optimization → Execution)
- **UVM Topology**: The log provides complete testbench hierarchy which is valuable for debugging
- **Timing Information**: Simulation timing is preserved in sanitized version for performance analysis
- **Security Best Practice**: Using environment variables makes the log portable across different systems

### Benefits for Project

1. **Reference Material**: New developers can understand expected DSIM output format
2. **Debugging Aid**: Sample shows successful execution pattern for comparison
3. **Documentation**: Complete test flow is documented through actual execution
4. **Security Compliance**: Personal information removed while maintaining technical value

### Next Steps

- Consider creating similar samples for different test scenarios
- Could add samples showing error cases for debugging reference
- May want to create automated sanitization script for future logs

### Files Modified

- Created: `docs/sample_execution_log.txt`
- Created: `docs/sample_execution_log_readme.md`
- Verified: `.gitignore` properly excludes actual logs

### Compliance with Guidelines

- Documentation written in English ✓
- Followed directory structure (`docs/` for documentation) ✓
- Security-sensitive information properly handled ✓
- Technical insights recorded for sharing ✓
